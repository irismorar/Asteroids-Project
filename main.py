#This line ensures the main() function is only called when this file is run directly; it won't run if it's imported as a module.
#It's considered the "pythonic" way to structure an executable program in Python. Technically,
#the program will work fine by just calling main(), but you might get an angry letter from Guido van Rossum if you don't.
